# Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, daily mini-projects that I build to practice and improve my development skills. Each project is simple, focused, and created with the intention of learning something new—whether it's a React concept, a UI idea, or a small JavaScript logic challenge.

## Overview

This repo is a growing collection of mini-projects that I work on regularly. Each project helps me practice:

* Frontend development
* React components and hooks
* JavaScript logic and problem-solving
* UI/UX design skills
* Reusable code patterns

These projects are not large-scale applications—they are small, quick builds meant to strengthen core concepts.

## Features

* Multiple daily practice mini-projects
* Clean and beginner-friendly code
* Covers UI components, logic challenges, small tools, etc.
* Continuously updated as new projects are added
* Great for quick learning and experimentation

## Tech Stack

Depending on the project, the stack may include:
* **React JS**
* **JavaScript**
* **HTML & CSS**
* **Tailwind / Custom Styling**
